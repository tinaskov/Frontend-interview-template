# Welcome to our little boilerplate!
This is a boilerplate for a React project using TypeScript, Vite, and Storybook.

It includes basic configurations to help you get started quickly.
It does not have an exhaustive set of features, it should serve as a starting point for your project.

# Assignment

The assignment is simple: 


**Create a simple Todo app, where you can add, remove, and toggle the completion status of tasks**

Timebox: 3-4 hours


### Features

You chose the features you want to implement, but here are some suggestions:

- As a user, I want to be able to add a new task with a title and description.
- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of tasks with their titles and completion status.
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle the completion status of a task.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a task from the list.
- As a user, I want to be able to filter tasks by their completion status (all, completed, active).
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the title and description of a task.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark all tasks as completed or active.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of active tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of completed tasks.

### API requests
For this assignment, please mock all API requests (e.g., fetching, adding, updating, or deleting tasks). 
You can use tools like [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io), custom mock functions, or any other approach you prefer.
There is no backend service provided.

### What are we looking for?
- Clean and maintainable code (Be prepared to explain why your code is clean and maintainable)
- Testing strategy including API mocks
- Basic styling (CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution)
- Good use of TypeScript features (interfaces, types, etc.)
- Use of React functional components and hooks
- Use of Storybook for development
- Out of the box thinking (feel free to add any additional features you think would be useful)

### What we are not looking for?
- Complex state management libraries (like Redux or MobX)
- Devops setup (like CI/CD)
- Complicated CSS solutions (unless it adds value)

Feel free to use any libraries or tools you find useful, but keep it simple and focused on the task at hand.
